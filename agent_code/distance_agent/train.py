    If a distance is obstructed, it's given as 0. For this reason, standing next to a crate gives a distance of 1 (to differentiate between walls and crates).
    The fifth entry states whether the agent is in the optimal spot, i.e. standing on top of a coin (can only happen at the start), standing next to a crate,
    standing in the blast radius of another player or being safe. Note that distances are given even if the agent is in the optimal spot.
    Distances are only given if the respective thing is being searched for. E.g. if the agent is not in danger, no safety distances will be given.
